#### `V5-T031` — Retire mock gradebook localStorage

- **Role / slot:** W03-A01; **priority:** `P0`; **classification:** PRODUCTION_COMPLETION.
- **Paths to inspect first:** `frontend/src/lib/imperial/submissions-api.ts`. Verify exact filenames against live checkout; create only missing target modules deliberately, not duplicate existing routers/tables.
- **Functional change / implementation contract:** Remove production INITIAL_STUDENT_SUBMISSIONS; typed DB client; demo-only fixtures separated.
- **Server/database interaction:** identify current endpoint, relevant SQLAlchemy row and gateway routing; define typed request-response; mutation must be atomic/idempotent and role scoped. If no backend route, make explicit target contract + tests before UI wiring. Do not claim database change complete until Alembic migration is verified on disposable DB. Record schema changes in `SCHEMA_DIFF`.
- **UI and error states:** cover loading, empty, success_confirmed, forbidden, conflict, offline/unavailable; no fake success and no secret/PII logs; accessibility keyboard/2D when relevant. Respect `DEMO_MODE=false` in production.
- **Negative/abuse test (must fail before fix):** Fresh production user sees no fictional names/grades.
- **Minimum acceptance:** positive flow persists through reload/restart and correct account; required negative test passes; import clients updated; no incompatible HTTP response silently ignored; any risk that remains filed with owner and severity.
- **Test artifacts:** create/extend targeted test near existing test suite (proposed name `tests/v5/test_v5_t031.py`; adapt to current framework), include API integration and, for browser flow, Playwright or verified manual run. Check `git diff --check`, TS typing/Python compile/Rust format for touched stack. A test marked NOT_RUN cannot count as PASS.
- **Isolation contract:** A01 may draft patches only inside described feature boundary. Shared model/migration/router generated types must be submitted as change proposal to coordinator for serialized integration. Do not edit another subagent's committed worktree.
- **Evidence required:** file:line before/after, test commands+outputs, negative case screenshot/log without PII, DB rows count or trace where relevant, feature flag, rollback plan, `HANDOFF_JSON` and reviewer sign-off.
- **Fail policy:** on auth/rights/PII/source issue => BLOCKED and flag OFF; on provider/network failure show typed unavailable; on version conflict ask retry/rebase; on missing dependency report missing details, do not invent API or data.

If any P0 issue or human sign-off pending: state `BLOCKED`; may start downstream design tasks but do not release dependent features.
