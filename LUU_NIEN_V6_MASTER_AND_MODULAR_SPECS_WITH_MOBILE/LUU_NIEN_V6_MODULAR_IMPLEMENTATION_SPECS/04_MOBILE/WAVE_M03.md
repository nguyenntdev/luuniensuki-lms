### `M03-A01` — Six-stage ELLO mobile runner

- **Owner:** `mobile-m03-a01` separate worktree; **allowed scope:** `mobile/lib/features/lesson/`. Other shared files are read-only until coordinator merge approves.
- **Read first:** `MASTER_SPEC.md`, `04_MOBILE/MOBILE_MASTER_SPEC.md`, relevant mobile domain spec, this ticket, then at most 3–8 directly related files in ZIP checkout. Confirm file/path existence before editing.
- **Objective / change:** source linked stage navigation. Never substitute a UI-only mock for backend persistence, rights, auth or validated source.
- **Minimal test-first approach:** reproduce one real failure, write fixture and failing regression test, change narrow module, compile/analyze, test positive and negative, produce screenshot/receipt for the new state.
- **Mandatory negative acceptance:** task answers no source while required => FAIL. Failure means `FAIL` or `BLOCKED`, not PASS.
- **Cross-stack check:** if API/schema/migration change required, create typed proposal + backend test; backend owner merges contract before Flutter client compiles. Don't edit another agent's source files.
- **Output artifact:** `artifacts/implementation/M03-A01/HANDOFF.json` containing `source_sha,modified_paths,tests[cmd,exit_code,stdout_path],negative_case,status,request_ids,unresolved_issues`, with no student PII.
- **Exit:** complete when relevant server data persists through restart, survives role-scoped auth and error injection, and Flutter client displays exact server state; platform tests labeled PASS/FAIL/NOT_RUN honestly.
